## Other Info

This game is poorly optimized and the code is not organized, in total it was made in about 12 consecutive hours which I believe it's pretty good. This was my first entry to a game jam and I plan on doing more in the future. There are no future updates planned for this game, and you are free to use my very bad code in whatever way you want. Thank you for playing.
